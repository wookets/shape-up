# shape-up

The following repo houses a few documents related to a "real world" example of [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) for a project that attempts to solve device registration for an enterprise.

## The Problem

Currently, across the organization, multiple business units implementa nd re-implement device registration for every product released to market. This is a timely process that consumes months of development time for each new product launch. 

Further more, the company is aiming to expand it's B2C surface area and device registration is seen as an area where we can make a meaningful impact in this direction - by allowing clinicians (and not the sales rep) to register the devices themselves, we can keep cost per new product down and increase our ability to scale. 

## Appetite

Given that the company only exists through the sale of new medical devices, there is a large appetite to solve this issue. 

## Solution

The first six weeks of this pitch, we will need to demonstrate the ability to show a UI form with the following basic elements and capture that data into a datastore. 


## Rabbit Holes

There are many known rabbit holes that will exist in future pitch documents. Please refer to the no-gos.
